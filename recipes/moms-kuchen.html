    <h4><em>Plum kuchen is a traditional northeastern European dessert</em></h4>
    <p>This recipe is exactly as my mom gave it to me. You should 
        probably use your own common sense to vary it, since I don’t 
        think my mom has ever actually measured anything in her life, 
        when it comes to cooking.
    </p>
    <h3><strong>Crust:<br>Ingredients</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups flour</li>
        <li>pinch of salt </li>
        <li>1 tsp. Baking powder</li>
        <li>1 package vanilla sugar (Oetker’s – 9 grams or .32 ounces)</li>
        <li>3/4 stick of butter at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>3/4 cup of sugar</li>
        <li>sprinkle of cold water or milk or liqueur</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Directions</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix everything together until you end up with a 
            sort of sticky cookie dough.</li>
        <li>Rub (additional) butter in your baking dish (I prefer a
             light coating of pan spray).</li>
        <li>Press it into a jelly roll pan or glass cake pan.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3><strong>Filling:</strong></h3>
    <p>Pretty much any kind of fruit you like. Mom usually uses the 
        little oval plums, unpeeled and sliced and sprinkles with a little
         sugar and cinnamon. I’ve used sliced, peeled apples with brown 
         sugar and cinnamon; strawberry jam; sliced peeled pears (though the 
         results with pears really vary depending on what kind they are and 
         how ripe they are); sliced peeled peaches with brown sugar and 
         pumpkin pie spice (the peaches get really sticky and juicy, so I’ve
          found that using a cake pan is better for them.) Ready made apple 
          or cherry pie fillings work OK, too.</p>
    <h3><strong>Topping:<br>Ingredients</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup flour</li>
        <li>1/2 stick of butter</li>
        <li>1/2 package vanilla sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 - 3/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>sprinkle of cold water, milk or liqueur</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Directions</strong></h3>
    <p><em>This works best if the butter is slightly warmer than refrigerator
        temperature. If the butter warms all the way to room temperature, it
        won't work very well.
    </em></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix half of the flour with the rest of the dry ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cut the butter into small pieces and soften with your hand
             in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Add the dry ingredients to the butter and work with your 
            fingertips.</li>     
        <li>Add a bit of the liquid.</li>
        <li>Add the rest of the flour little by little until you get 
            the crumb texture you’re looking for.</li>
        <li>Bake at 375 in a pre-heated oven. The time varies a lot 
            depending on the size of the pan and the fruit you use. 
            Check after about 15 minutes use you judgement after that.</li>
    </ol>
