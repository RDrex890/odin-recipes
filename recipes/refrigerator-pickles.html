    <h4><em>Homemade refrigerator pickles are a cool,
        crunchy treat!
    </em></h4>
    <p>I was shocked when I found out how easy refrigerator pickles are to
         make. Not only are they delightful using the base recipe, there are 
         hundreds of variations you can make using different vegetables and spices.
