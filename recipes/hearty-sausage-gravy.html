    <h4><em>A hearty breakfast including biscuits and 
        gravy</em></h4>
    <p>Biscuits and gravy are one of the ultimate comfort foods
        of middle america. This recipe is my own personal take
        on this dish.
    </p>
    <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped onions</li>
        <li>1 cup sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 pound ground pork sausage</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>4 cups milk or cream</li>
        <li>1-1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    </ul>
    <em>Optional to your tastes:</em>
    <ul>
        <li>fresh or dried, chopped parsley</li>
        <li>salt-free herb blend</li>
        <li>rosemary</li>
        <li>dried red pepper flakes</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Directions</strong></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Saute onions and mushrooms in 3 tablespoons of butter in a
            large pot or dutch oven, stirring steadily.</li>
        <li>Crumble in sausage just as onions and mushrooms start to 
            soften. Stir constantly. When sausage is completely cooked 
            (but NOT browned), drain contents on pot into a colander 
            and allow oils to collect in a dish. Set aside sausage 
            mixture.</li>
        <li>Melt 4 tablespoons of butter in the same pot and add 1 
             tablespoon of the drained oils. </li>  
        <li>Whisk the flour into the butter/oil mixture. The result 
            should be the consistency of a thick paste (roux), but not 
            too dry. (If you have to add extra flour or drained oil to 
            achieve the correct consistency, you should do so, but note 
            that this may require you to add a bit more milk or cream 
            to get the gravy texture you want.) </li>      
        <li>Cook for about 2 minutes, whisking very frequently until 
            the roux is golden in color and bubbling.</li>    
        <li>Whisk in milk or cream and turn on medium high. Whisk 
            constantly until mixture starts to bubble consistently.</li>    
        <li>Turn heat to medium-low, continue stirring often.</li>
        <li>Stir in salt, pepper and garlic powder.</li>
        <li>After 5 â€“ 10 minutes, your gravy should be the right 
            texture. Add in sausage mixture, and allow to simmer for at 
            least 5 minutes, so that the sausage  is completely re-heated.
        </li>
        <li>Add extra seasonings to taste.</li>
        <li>Serve over your favorite biscuits.</li>
    </ol>
