The Odin Project html practice project
This is the first project from the The Odin Project study course. The purpose of this project is to practice command line (bash on a mac for me), git, github, and an introduction to HTML. The HTML topics covered thus far are elements, tags, creating an HTML boilerplate file, working with text within an HTML file, lists, links and images.
